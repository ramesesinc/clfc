==========================
 SETTING UP CLFC SERVER   
==========================
1) Open the file bin/server.conf and change the directory paths of home.url property.  

2) Open the file workspace/web/anubis.hosts and change the directory paths. 

3) Go to the directory workspace/services/datasources to locate all datasource files. 
   Open each file and setup the correct database connection settings. 

   Notes: 
	  For database accounts we recommend the root account to be binded to all application servers. 
	  The root account will only used for administrators and application servers and bind to specific IPs.
   
4) To run the server, go to the bin/ directory and execute the following command:

   [root@centOS]$ chmod +x *.sh
   [root@centOS]$ ./run.sh 
   
   Notes: 
	  The first command is executed only once to give the file a permission to execute. 
	  The second command will be used always every time you run the server. 
	  The user must be a sudoer to properly run the server since I/O operations are done always.
